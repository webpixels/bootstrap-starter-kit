## Requirements

* [**Bootstrap 5**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs)
* [**Webpixels CSS**](https://webpixels.io/docs/css/)
* [**Eleventy**](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/)
* [**Nunjucks**](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html)
* [**Parcel**](https://parceljs.org/docs/)

## Getting Started

For easier asset management we've chosen [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). If you want to see all the npm scripts included for this starter kit, open the `package.json` file.

Next, navigate to the root folder of the site and run:

```
npm install
```

To run a local server and watch for changes:

```
npm start
```

To build for production:

```
npm run build
```

There is also a tutorial available on our website that explains the most important steps for the setup process. Read more about thow to [build JAMstack-ready sites with Bootstrap and 11ty (Eleventy)](https://webpixels.io/blog/how-to-get-started-with-bootstrap-and-eleventy).
